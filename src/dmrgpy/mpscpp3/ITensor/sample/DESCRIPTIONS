dmrg - simple ground-state DMRG of spin chains

dmrgj1j2 - DMRG for the J1-J2 spin chain
           J2/J1 = 0.5 is the AKLT point with
           bond dimension 2 ground state

dmrg_table - DMRG sample code which takes an 
             external input file (inputfile_dmrg_table)

exthubbard - DMRG calculation for ground state of 
             extended Hubbard model 
             Uses inputfile_exthubbard for 
             input parameters

mixedspin - demo code showing how to make and use
            a site set with alternating S=1/2 and
            S=1 spins

trg - tensor renormalization group (TRG) algorithm
      for computing properties of large 2D classical
      stat mech systems
