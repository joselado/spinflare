To use these project template files to create
your own code based on ITensor, follow these steps:

1. Make a new folder *outside* of the ITensor source
   code folder and copy these files (Makefile, myappname.cc,
   myclass.h) to it.

2. Edit the Makefile, following the numbered instructions 1-5
   at the top.

3. Run the "make" command. If you see some warnings, it is ok.
   The compilation was successful if the binary (executable)
   file "myappname" is created. Try running this program.

4. Now begin customizing the files as you wish. You can
   of course rename myappname.cc to any other file name 
   as long as you update the Makefile accordingly.
   You also do not need to include the myclass.h header
   file; it is just provided as an example.
